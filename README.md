# exercise-1.5

## Background
The website was built using ReactJs as the library, this was to allow for reasuable components, page switching and also to use certain hooks to allow for animations in the pages.

The use of SASS preproccessor is also throughout the site and in conjunction BEM model for nesting and effeciency  when styling the webpage.

Debugging the website was done using VSCode and the chrome dev tools this allows me to see errors and also observe changes when testing new features

•	react-router-dom - this was used in order to allow switching to different routes and display different pages on the website

•	material-ui - used for icons such as the trash can as well as the checkout and social media icons
